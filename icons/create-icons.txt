ICON CREATION INSTRUCTIONS
===========================

To create proper PNG icons for this extension:

1. Create the following PNG files in this icons/ directory:
   - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - icon32.png (32x32 pixels)
   - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
   - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

2. Design suggestions:
   - Use the extension's blue color (#1976d2)
   - Include a "block" or "shield" symbol
   - Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

3. You can use any image editor like:
   - GIMP (free)
   - Photoshop
   - Canva
   - Figma
   - Online icon generators

4. After creating the icons, update manifest.json to include:
   
   "icons": {
     "16": "icons/icon16.png",
     "32": "icons/icon32.png", 
     "48": "icons/icon48.png",
     "128": "icons/icon128.png"
   },
   
   "action": {
     "default_popup": "popup.html",
     "default_title": "Website Blocker",
     "default_icon": {
       "16": "icons/icon16.png",
       "32": "icons/icon32.png",
       "48": "icons/icon48.png",
       "128": "icons/icon128.png"
     }
   }

5. The extension will work without icons, but having proper icons improves the user experience.

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
The extension is configured to work without icons for now. 
You can install and test it immediately, then add icons later.
